While they demonstrated potential for precise diagnosis and treatment, they were often costly to build and brittle, struggling to encode higher-order interactions among different pieces of knowledge. Their performance was limited by the comprehensiveness of prior medical knowledge and they often did not show significant improvement over human diagnosticians. Furthermore, they were inadequately integrated into clinician workflows and medical record systems, proving challenging to maintain due to the constant evolution of medical knowledge. They also struggled to cope with the vast and complex data generated by 'omic-based' approaches (genomic, proteomic, metabolic).

•	Emergence of Machine Learning

o	Addressing Limitations: Unlike the first generation, recent AI research has leveraged machine learning (ML) methods to overcome these limitations. ML allows computers to acquire knowledge from data without the need for explicit programming. These algorithms utilize extensive datasets to detect patterns and provide predictions or judgments based on available information.

o	Core Principles: Machine learning algorithms can account for complex interactions and identify patterns from data without requiring the specification of decision rules for each task. It has become the preferred framework for building AI utilities. ML broadly falls into two categories:

o	Supervised Machine Learning: Involves collecting a large number of "training" cases with both inputs (e.g., fundus photographs) and desired output labels (e.g., presence or absence of diabetic retinopathy). The algorithm learns to produce the correct output for new cases by analyzing patterns in these labeled pairs.


•	Unsupervised Machine Learning: Infers underlying patterns in unlabeled data to find sub-clusters, identify outliers, or produce low-dimensional representations of the data.

•	The Deep Learning Revolution


	Definition and Resurgence: The recent "renaissance" in AI, especially in medical-image analysis, has been largely driven by the successful application of deep learning. Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that employs artificial neural networks with many layers (known as 'deep' neural networks) to identify patterns in data. This approach has shown substantial improvements in image classification tasks since.
	Key Enablers:

	Large-Scale Data Acquisition: Deep learning algorithms are "data hungry". The recent availability of large sources of medical data, such as Electronic Health Records (EHRs), medical imaging, and data from large-scale studies like the Cancer Genome Atlas and UK Biobank, has been crucial.
